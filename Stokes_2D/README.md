# Stokes Problem (2D)

The following directory contains the application of a 2D axi-symmetric Stokes Problem. 

The geometry is created using GMSH. Two different pipelines are proposed. It consists in two rectangles of different heights with an inflow imposed on the left side and a no slip condition for the upper sides.
